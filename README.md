# Life Tracker Spreadsheet

Spreadsheet designed to track and graph everything in your day to day life. 

Automation optional but set up to support, second page of graphing included. 

If starting the sheet at a date that is not the first of the month the graphing sheets must be altered to suit the duration of that month and the proceeding months. 

the sheet is prepared to handle automatic colour coding for tick boxes (which are graphed) and temperature, though further conditional formatting is encouraged but not preset.
